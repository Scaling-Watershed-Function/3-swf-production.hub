# Accumulated Network Calculations 

In the data from "Attributes for NHDPlus Version 2.1 Reach Catchments and Modified Routed Upstream Watersheds for the Conterminous United States: Average Monthly Runoff (mm) from McCabe and Wolock's Runoff Model Over Period of Record, 1951-2000", two different routing methods were used: 

1) divergence-routed and 
2) total cumulative drainage area.

Please look for more details in: An Enhanced Hydrologic Stream Network Based on the NHDPlus Medium Resolution Dataset

**NOTE**:It seems more logical for our analysis to use total cumulative drainage area values, but we need to double check the difference between the two approaches. 

**NOTE**: The study period considered by [[Kyongho Son]] goes from 1/1/1980 to 12/31/2021. That mean that averages for other variables (e.g. hydrology, climate, etc.) would preferably fall within that time period.
