# Supplementary Information

(first draft)

## Data sources

This project combines multiple databases to incorporate a larger number of explanatory/contextual variables than Son et al., 2022. We expanded the number of variables to aid the interpretation of our results in the context of the river network structure.

The bulk of the input data for our analysis comes from tabular data for:

1.  Catchment and stream networks attributes: based on the report ["An Enhanced Hydrologic Stream Network Based on the NHDPlus Medium Resolution Dataset"](https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2019/5127/sir20195127.pdf)
2.  Additional catchment attributes including land use from: [Select Attributes for NHDPlus Version 2.1 Reach Catchments and Modified Network Routed Upstream Watersheds for the Conterminous United States](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5669a79ee4b08895842a1d47)

The data are detailed below (this table needs to be updated before submission with the list of files used for the analysis):
